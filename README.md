# This is a repository for Covid Analysis. #

In this project, a deep learning model with LSTM neural network and RNN is used to predict new
cases in Malaysia using the past 30 days of number of cases.

How to run the file?

1. Clone the repository
2. In terminal, cd into the covid_analysis/python_files
3. run python3 covid.py

or, can just run in VsCode

The architechture of the the LSTM-RNN model is as following:
